# Kickstarter Data Organizing and Analysis in Excel

## Background:
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the projectâ€™s initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.

## Objective: 
Analyze a dataset consisting of 4,000 crowdfunding projects to uncover hidden trends, create charts and tables, and interpret the data in Excel.
  
* Sheet 1- Cover sheet
* Sheet 2- Kickstarter data set with conditional formatting with 3-color scale for "state" of the project, new columns created using formulae- 
    O- Percentage Funded
    P- Average Donations by Backers
    Q- splitting Category/Sub-category into Category
    R- splitting Category/Sub-category into Sub-Category
    S- Date stamp conversion for Date Created
    T- Date stamp conversion for Date Ended
* Sheet 3- Category- pivot table and chart- for number of projects in each category
* Sheet 4- Sub-Category- pivot table and chart- for number of projects in each Sub-Category
* Sheet 5- Date Created Conversion- pivot table and chart- with values of Count of state, filtered by the year of the project.
* Sheet 6- Report
* Sheet 7- Deeper Analysis (bonus activities): sorted projects depending on their goal values, with ability to tell their percentage of success for a specific year. The sheet includes a chart to represent this new data.
* Sheet 8- Statistical Table and Analysis (bonus activity 2)- evaluated data to determine if its meaningful, and what values better help user to make a decision.

## Conclusions:

* Category Analysis: KickStarter campaigns in music, theater and film & video have the highest success rates at 77%, 60% and 58% respectively. On the other hand food, publishing, and games categories have lower success rates at 17%, 34% and 36%. Also, the technology category has the most cancellations (51% of all the events) and has a cancellation rate of 1/3 for that category.

* Sub-Category Analysis: The sub-categories rock, documentary, and hardware have a success rate of 100%, while the sub-categories animation, drama, and video games have a 100% failure rate. The sub-category 'plays' has the most number of campaigns, 1066.

* Month Analysis: The time of the year matters when campaigning. The month of May had the best success rate of 61%, while the month of December showed the lowest success rate of 44%.

* Goal amount Analysis: The lower goal amounts show better success rate. The goal amounts above the $45,000 show a decline in success rate, and increase in cancellation and failure rates.

## Limitations of dataset: 
* The dataset includes some projects that had a very low goal but a high pledged amount. These are the outliers for Percentage Funded. 
* Some of the categories/sub-categories don't have projects in all years/months, so there is no continuous relationship over the time. 
* One third of the projects come from a single category- theater. So, it limits the span of categories to choose from.
